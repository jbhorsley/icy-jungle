Sprint 2 – Retrospective
Date: Nov 12 , 2025
Attendees: Full team (4 members)

What Went Well

First Render deployment worked on first attempt.

Django auth and migrations ran without issues.

Team communication improved via daily check-ins and branch discipline.

What Didn’t Go Well

Some migration files conflicted across branches.

Limited test coverage beyond models reduced confidence in integration flows.

What To Improve

Review migration files before merging branches.
 → Action: Assign one developer each sprint to approve migrations (PR gatekeeper).

Expand automated testing to views and API routes.
 → Action: Add integration test stories to Sprint 3 backlog.

Begin user testing sessions earlier to catch UX issues.
 → Action: Schedule 3 user tests once Sprint 3 beta deploys (late Nov).
