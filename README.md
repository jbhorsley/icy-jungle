Idea 2

  Tagline: “The social radar for your city — discover and join real-world events around you.” 
 
  Major User Journeys 
  
    As a host:
    
      I open the app, tap “Create Event,” and add details (name, description, time, location, image). 
      I choose whether it’s private (invite-only) or public (visible to everyone nearby). 
      I share a link or QR code with friends or let it appear in the local event feed. 
      I can manage RSVPs, edit details, and see who’s interested or attending. 
    
    As a guest: 
    
      I log in and see a map or feed of nearby public events — bar trivia nights, outdoor workouts, block parties, etc. 
      I can filter by type (social, fitness, nightlife, community) or proximity. 
      I tap on an event to see who’s going, message the host, or RSVP. 
      I can also create my own small gathering and make it discoverable to people nearby. 
    
    As a venue (e.g., bar, café, gym): 
    
      I post upcoming events or promotions (e.g., “Live music tonight” or “Trivia Wednesday”) visible to people in the area. 
      I can mark events as recurring and track attendance over time.

        Users and venues can create events and choose visibility (public/private).

      Smart local feed:
